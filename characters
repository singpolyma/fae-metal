Character creation follows FAE.  Your high concept must be derived from the instrument that you play in the band.  For example:

* Fingers that pick fire
* Let me show you my double bass pedal
* Voice of the mighty river

You should also have an aspect that indicates your affiliation to the band, or hints at how you came to metal.  For example:

* The band is my family
* Thirst for power
* Fan first, master later

Band members with a less portable instrument (such as a drum kit or organ) should create a stunt that affords them greater power when they are set up with their best tools.  For example:

* I get +2 when I Flashily Attack using my drumkit.
* I get +2 when I Forcefully Create Advantages using my organ.

Such band members will also want to decide what kind of musical ability they have when not at their full instrument.  Do they have no music whatsoever?  Do they sing backup?  Do they have part of the instrument that is more portable but has less effect than the whole thing?  The band will also want to decide what kind of conveyance they have for any gear that isn't easily portable, including some instruments but possibly also including stage equiptment, sound equiptment, etc.
