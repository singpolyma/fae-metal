In this game you will play as a member of a heavy metal band in a world where music has power.  You might say that music is "magical", though the residents of this world might not always agree.  Music is not supernatural, nor does it derive power from supernatural beings, but rather it has a completely natural effect on the world around it.  When a soft ballad moves hardened warriors to tears, that is the power of music.  When an army's warsong causes the enemy to lose their resolve, that is the power of music.  When a pigeon's birdsong is harnessed to communicate verbally over unlimited distances, that is the power of music.

For the most part, this world is much like your imaginings of Medieval Europe.  Horses, knights, kings, city walls, peasant farmers, taverns, and travelling bards are all things you will find here.  Most of the music you will find fits this: bardic tales that inform the mind and melt the soul, monkish chants that strengthen people in unity, flutes that please the lazy ear.  There are some very talented musicians around, but in many rural areas a bird is the most talented musician anyone will hear, its song lifting it into the air.

You are a heavy metal band.  Your music is not so much feared and hated as it is completely unfamiliar.  You may have access to any stage or sound equiptment that is reasonable for a heavy metal band, even if the tech level seems mismatched with your otherwise Medieval imaginings.  This virtually unknown form of music is the most powerful in the world, and you are some of the most masterful users of it.  In your repertoire you may have, when played well, the pieces necessary to have effects on the world that superstitious locals may mistake for supernatural power.
